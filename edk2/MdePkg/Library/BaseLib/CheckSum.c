  Returns the sum of all elements in a buffer in unit of UINT8.
  During calculation, the carry bits are dropped.

  This function calculates the sum of all elements in a buffer
  in unit of UINT8. The carry bits in result of addition are dropped.
  The result is returned as UINT8. If Length is Zero, then Zero is
  returned.

  If Buffer is NULL, then ASSERT().
  If Length is greater than (MAX_ADDRESS - Buffer + 1), then ASSERT().

  @param  Buffer      The pointer to the buffer to carry out the sum operation.
  @param  Length      The size, in bytes, of Buffer.

  @return Sum         The sum of Buffer with carry bits dropped during additions.
